MOV AX,BX //send the contents of BX to AX
MOV AX,[3]  //send the contents of Unit 3 to AX
MOV AX,18 //send 18 to AX
ADD AX,8 //AX=AX+8
ADD AX,BX //AX=AX+BX

Address Bus,Data Bus,Control Bus

8086: 16-Bit data bus, 20-Bit address bus,the size of address space is 1MB while 80386 has 32-Bit address bus(4GB address space)



89D8H means 89D8 hex, 10100011B means 10100011 binary

BIOS:Basic Input/Outpus System

ADDRESS SPACE: defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a network host, peripheral device, disk sector, a memory cell or other logical or physical entity. 

Internal bus/External bus

8086 has 14 registers:(16-Bit register)AX,BX,CX,DX,SI,DI,SP,BP,IP,CS,SS,DS,ES,PSW
general registers:AX BX CX DX
segment registers:CS DS SS ES
For compatible with 8-bit register CPU(8085,8080):AX(AH,AL) BX(AH,AL) CX(CH,CL) DX(DH,DL)

1 word=2 bytes

Segment Address(段地址）/Offset Address(偏移地址） Physical address=SA*16+EA
For example:123C8H=1230H*16+00C8H     data in 1230:00C8
The maximum size of a segment is 64KB

CS(Code Segment):IP(Instruction Pointer)
After restart,default CS:IP is FFFF:0000.The the first instruction after restart is from FFFF0H

jmp 2AE3:3 CS=2AE3H,IP=0003H
jmp 3:0B16 CS=0003H,IP=0B16H

Only change IP method: jmp ax(means: mov IP,ax)
before: ax=1000H,CS=2000H,IP=0003H
after:ax=1000H,CS=2000H,IP=1000H
